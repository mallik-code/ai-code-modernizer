LangGraph is very low-level, and focued on enterely on agent orchestration. Before learning LnagGraph, familarize with Models and Tools.

Models: LLMs (Large Language Models) are powerful AI tools that can interpret and generate text like humans.  They are versatile enough to write content, transalte languages, summarize, and answer questions wthout needing specialized training for each task.

In addtion to text generation, many models support:

    . Tool calling - calling external tools (like database queries or API calls) and use results in their   responses.

    . Structured output - returning structured data (like JSON or XML) instead of plain text.
    . Multimodality - process and return data other than text, like images or audio.
    . Reasoning - models perform multi-step reasoning to arrive at a conclusion.

    . Function calling - calling other functions or agents and use results in their responses.
